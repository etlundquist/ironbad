An AI-enabled Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) platform built with FastAPI and Next.js. This project takes inspiration from [Ironclad](https://ironcladapp.com/) and serves as a sample implementation exploring various LLM/GenAI tools and methodologies for contract analysis, Q&A, and intelligent document redlining.

## Overview

Ironbad provides an end-to-end solution for contract review, leveraging AI to automate ingestion, analysis, and review workflows. The platform parses contracts into structured sections, matches input sections to standard clauses, identifies and resolves compliance issues, and offers both a simple RAG-based Q&A chat and an AI agent capable of making contract annotations and revisions as well as answering questions with rich inline citations. Users may view/edit contract sections and make/edit/resolve annotations including comments, revisions, section adds, and section removes themselves or collaboratively with an AI agent.

## Usage Workflow

1. **Upload Contract:** Navigate to `/upload` and drag-and-drop a PDF or DOCX file
2. **Ingest:** Click "Ingest" on the contract list to trigger parsing and embedding generation
3. **Analyze:** Click "Analyze" to run clause matching and issue detection
4. **Review:** View extracted clauses and identified issues on the contract detail page
5. **Chat:** Ask questions about the contract content using the RAG-based chat interface
6. **Redline:** Use the review workspace with the AI agent to make annotations and revisions

## Key Technologies & Patterns

### Backend Patterns
- **Async-first:** All I/O operations use `async`/`await`
- **Feature-based organization:** Vertical slices with minimal cross-dependencies
- **Dependency injection:** FastAPI dependencies for sessions and configuration
- **Type safety:** Pydantic schemas for validation, SQLAlchemy models for persistence
- **Background processing:** Taskiq for long-running ingestion and analysis tasks

### Frontend Patterns
- **Type safety:** Full TypeScript with strict mode
- **Separation of concerns:** Pages, components, hooks, API clients, and types
- **Error handling:** Toast notifications for all user feedback
- **Real-time updates:** SSE for contract status changes and agent progress
- **Custom hooks:** Encapsulated business logic (useContract, useAgentChat, etc.)

### AI/LLM Integration
- **Vector search:** pgvector for semantic clause matching
- **RAG pattern:** Context injection from vector-retrieved sections
- **Agent framework:** OpenAI Agents SDK with custom tools for contract operations
- **Streaming:** Token-by-token responses via SSE for better UX
- **Embeddings:** OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1536 dimensions)
