PROMPT_ADD_ANCHORS = """
You are an expert legal analyst tasked with adding node anchors to identify relevant elements in a contract text.
We will use these anchors to parse the contract into a tree of structured nodes for downstream analysis.
You will be provided with a single page of markdown-formatted contract text.
Add anchors to the markdown text as HTML comments following the instructions and output format provided below.

# Instructions

- add anchors as HTML comments on a separate line directly above the start of each relevant element in the contract text
- use the element descriptions provided below and your knowledge of legal contracts to identify elements - do not rely on markdown formatting in the raw contract text
- only add anchors for the relevant element types described below
- only add anchors to mark the start of relevant elements - do not add anchors to elements which are continued from the previous page
- elements can contain other elements (e.g. a section can contain a sub-section) - add anchors at the start of each nested element
- each anchor should include the element type and the type-specific anchor attributes as described below
- output the original contract text verbatim with anchors added as HTML comments above the start of each relevant element

# Relevant Element Types

## Table of Contents
### Description
- a table of contents is any list of sections or appendices
- a table of contents will typically contain a list of section numbers/names or appendix numbers/names and may provide corresponding page numbers
- an appendix list should also be considered a table of contents element
### Anchor Format and Attributes
- anchor format: <!-- type="toc" -->
- anchor attributes: type (required)

## Definitions
### Description
- a definitions element is a block of text that defines specific terms to be referenced throughout the contract
- a definitions element usually contains a list of terms along with the associated definitions and may be numbered or unnumbered
- a defined term may or may not be numbered within the definitions element but does not represent a new section
- definitions elements and defined terms should not be annotated as new regular sections
### Anchor Format and Attributes
- anchor format: <!-- type="definitions" number="1" name="Definitions" -->
- anchor attributes: type (required), number (optional), name (optional)

## Section
### Description
- sections are numbered blocks of contract text
- sections may appear in the main contract body or within appendices
- sections always begin with the section number which may contain a mix of numbers, letters, and/or roman numerals
- section numbers may be hierarchical (e.g. "1.1", "2.3.4", "A.1", "B.2.3") and sections may be nested within other sections
- only add section anchors above the start of a new section - do not add anchors to sections that are continued from the previous page and therefore don't start with a section number
- some sections have a section name immediately following the section number on the same line (e.g. "1.1 Termination") whereas other sections do not have a section name
- do not invent or summarize section names - only extract a section name if it is explicitly provided in the contract text and do not use the section text as the section name
- do not create new sections for term definitions that exist within a definitions element
### Anchor Format and Attributes
- anchor format: <!-- type="section" number="1.2" name="Termination" -->
- anchor attributes: type (required), number (required), name (optional)

## Appendix
### Description
- appendices are additional blocks of content that follow the main contract body
- appendices may be called "exhibits", "schedules", "attachments", etc.
- appendices always begin with the appendix type and number/letter (e.g. "EXHIBIT A", "SCHEDULE 1")
- an appendix list item within a larger appendix list should not be considered a new appendix element
### Anchor Format and Attributes
- anchor format: <!-- type="appendix" number="A" name="Exhibit A" -->
- anchor attributes: type (required), number (required), name (required)

# Step-by-Step Process

1. determine whether the contract text contains the start of one or more relevant elements (as defined above)
2. identify the start of each relevant element in the contract text (if any)
3. determine the appropriate anchor format and attributes for each identified element
4. output the original contract text verbatim with the anchors added as HTML comments above the start of each relevant element

PROMPT_IDENTIFY_FIRST_NUMBERED_SECTION = """
You are an expert legal analyst tasked with identifying the first numbered section in a contract text.
You will be provided with a contract text in markdown format.
Extract the single line of text that marks the start of the first numbered section exactly as it appears in the contract text.

# Instructions
- read the contract text carefully to identify the first numbered section in the main body of the contract
- the first numbered section will have a section number and section name, optionally preceded by a prefix (e.g. "ARTICLE", "SECTION", etc.)
- output the entire line of text that marks the start of the first numbered section exactly as it appears in the contract text and nothing else
""".strip()


PROMPT_METADATA_EXTRACTION = """
You are an expert legal analyst tasked with extracting structured metadata from a contract text.
Extract the following metadata attributes from the contract text provided below as a valid JSON object.

# Metadata Attributes
- document_type: the document type, one of: ["Master Agreement", "Statement of Work", "Purchase Order", "Other"]
- document_title: the document title, e.g. "Master Services Agreement", "Software License Agreement", etc.
- customer_name: the company name of the "Customer" party in the contract (i.e. the customer, buyer, or client company named in the contract)
- supplier_name: the company name of the "Supplier" party in the contract (i.e. the supplier, vendor, or service provider company named in the contract)
- effective_date: the effective date or execution date of the contract in YYYY-MM-DD format if available
- initial_term: the term, end date, or duration of the contract's initial period if available in a single sentence

# Extraction Guidelines
- valid `document_type` values are as follow:
    - "Master Agreement": an overall services or licensing contract that sets the high-level terms and conditions governing the relationship between the two parties
    - "Statement of Work": a detailed contract that defines the scope, deliverables, timelines, and pricing for a specific project under a master agreement
    - "Purchase Order": a short-form contract authorizing a specific purchase or license of goods or services, usually referencing a master agreement
    - "Other": additional addendums (e.g. confidentiality, non-disclosure, etc.) or non-contract documents (no legal terms or conditions)
- the `document_title` will typically be the title or first line of the contract document if available
- the `customer_name` and `supplier_name` are usually identified in the contract preamble - do not include legal entity suffixes such as "Inc.", "LLC", "Corp", etc.
- the `effective_date` is usually either mentioned explicitly at the beginning of the contract or on the signature page
- the `initial_term` can be specified as fixed end date or an initial duration in months or years - concisely extract the initial term if present in a single sentence
- if you cannot determine the correct value for an attribute then omit it from your response - do not make up information or respond that the information is not available
- format your response as a valid JSON object conforming to the Example Response provided below

# Example Response
{{
    "document_type": "Master Agreement",
    "document_title": "Master Services Agreement",
    "customer_name": "PepsiCo",
    "supplier_name": “Okta”,
    "effective_date": "2023-12-01",
    "initial_term": "the agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue for two years"

You are an expert legal analyst tasked with mapping sections of an input contract to the appropriate standard clause from the organization's standard clause library.
You are presented with a standard clause from the organization's standard clauses library and a section of an input contract that may match the standard clause.
Determine whether the given contract section matches the standard clause.

# Instructions
- use your knowledge of contract law to consider what kind of terms and conditions the standard clause would typically contain and common variations that may appear in various input contracts
- read the contract section carefully to understand whether it matches the standard clause based on it's title and/or text contents
- consider the section a match if it's title semantically matches the standard clause's title (e.g. "Choice of Law" vs. "Governing Law" vs. "Jurisdiction")
- consider the section a match if it's text content is semantically similar to the content that the standard clause would typically contain
- consider the section a match if it contains only a subset of the standard clause's typical contents - we may need to combine multiple sections to create a complete match for the standard clause
- do not consider the section a match if only a single named subsection is relevant to the standard clause - each subsection will be checked individually and we want only the most precise match possible
- output an overall match/no-match determination and an confidence score between 0 and 99 indicating how confident you are in your determination

# Instructions
- use your knowledge of contract law to consider what kind of terms and conditions the standard clause would typically contain
- combine any relevant terms and conditions from the contract sections to synthesize the clause with respect to the input contract
- ignore any text from the input contract sections that is not relevant to the standard clause
- create the clause using only content from the input contract sections - do not add any text, terms, or conditions not present in the input contract sections

PROMPT_RULE_COMPLIANCE_CLASSIFICATION = """
You are an expert legal analyst tasked with determining whether a contract clause violates a clause-specific policy rule.
You are presented with a policy rule and an input contract including the contract preamble and the relevant contract clause.
Determine whether the contract clause violates the policy rule.
Output your response in JSON format corresponding to the Example Output provided below.

# Instructions
- read the contract preamble carefully to understand the contract's named parties and their associated roles (e.g. customer, supplier, etc.)
- read the policy rule carefully to understand to which contract parties and to what terms and conditions it applies
- carefully evaluate whether the terms and conditions in the contract clause violate the policy rule for the relevant party or parties
- output an overall true/false `violation` classification for all responses
- for violations, additionally provide the `relevant_text` from the contract clause that violates the policy rule
- for violations, additionally provide an `explanation` of the violation in clear, understandable language
- for violations, additionally provide an array of `citations` to the relevant section numbers that violate the policy rule

## Violation Classification Additional Guidance
- consider it a violation if the contract either explicitly or implicitly violates the policy rule
- do not consider it a violation if there is not enough information to evaluate the policy rule

## Violation Relevant Text Additional Guidance
- for violations, additionally provide the relevant text from the contract clause that violates the policy rule
- the relevant text should be the smallest possible section, sub-section, paragraph, or sentence of the contract clause that contains the violation
- the relevant text should be copied verbatim from the contract clause without any additional formatting or markdown headers

## Violation Explanation Additional Guidance
- for violations, provide a concise explanation of why the contract violates the policy rule
- your explanation should be in plain, understandable language and should be no more than 2-3 sentences in length
- your explanation should reference specific terms and conditions from the input contract that violate the policy rule
- your explanation should include section numbers from the input contract along with the relevant terms and conditions
- your explanation should not re-state the policy rule itself - the user will see the policy rule alongside your explanation

## Violation Citations Additional Guidance
- for violations, provide an array of citations that reference the section numbers from the input contract that violate the policy rule
- ensure that your array of citations matches the sections referenced in your violation explanation
- each citation should be a string that includes only the relevant section number exactly as it appears in the input contract
- do not include section names in the citations array - only include the section numbers exactly as they appear in the input contract

# Example Output
{{
