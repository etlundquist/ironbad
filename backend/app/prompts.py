PROMPT_CLEAN_MARKDOWN = """
You are presented with markdown text parsed from a single page of a PDF legal contract.
You task is to clean the parsed markdown text to prepare the document for further processing.
Clean the markdown text by applying the following rules:

- convert all sections to the following format: "## <section_number> <section_name>\n<section_text>"
    - <section_number> is the section number exactly as it appears in the contract text
    - <section_name> is the section name (if present) following the section number on the same line
    - <section_text> is the section body text following the section number/name until the next section number/name
    - the section number may be alphanumeric and/or hierarchical (e.g. "1.1", "2.3.4", "A.1", "B.2.3")
    - some sections do not have section names - in these cases omit the <section_name> from the output
    - all section numbers must be appear on a separate line with "##" markdown headers
    - the section text must be output on subsequent lines following the section number/name
- convert all exhibit, schedule, attachment, etc. appendix headers to the following format: "## <appendix_type> <appendix_number> <appendix_name>"
    - <appendix_type> is the type of the appendix header (e.g. "EXHIBIT", "SCHEDULE", "ATTACHMENT", etc.) exactly as it appears in the contract text
    - <appendix_number> is the number of the appendix header exactly as it appears in the contract text
    - <appendix_name> is the name of the appendix header exactly as it appears following the appendix number on the same line
    - every appendix header should have a <appendix_type> and <appendix_number> but not all headers have a <appendix_name>
    - any appendix text that appears after the appendix type/number/name on the same line should be moved to the next line
- only lines with section headers should have "##" markdown headers - all other lines should be regular text

PROMPT_METADATA_EXTRACTION = """
You are an expert legal analyst tasked with extracting structured metadata from a contract text.
Extract the following metadata attributes from the contract text provided below as a valid JSON object.

# Metadata Attributes
- document_type: the document type, one of: ["Master Agreement", "Statement of Work", "Purchase Order", "Other"]
- document_title: the document title, e.g. "Master Services Agreement", "Software License Agreement", etc.
- customer_name: the company name of the "Customer" party in the contract (i.e. the customer, buyer, or client company named in the contract)
- supplier_name: the company name of the "Supplier" party in the contract (i.e. the supplier, vendor, or service provider company named in the contract)
- effective_date: the effective date or execution date of the contract in YYYY-MM-DD format if available
- initial_term: the term, end date, or duration of the contract's initial period if available in a single sentence

# Extraction Guidelines
- valid `document_type` values are as follow:
    - "Master Agreement": an overall services or licensing contract that sets the high-level terms and conditions governing the relationship between the two parties
    - "Statement of Work": a detailed contract that defines the scope, deliverables, timelines, and pricing for a specific project under a master agreement
    - "Purchase Order": a short-form contract authorizing a specific purchase or license of goods or services, usually referencing a master agreement
    - "Other": additional addendums (e.g. confidentiality, non-disclosure, etc.) or non-contract documents (no legal terms or conditions)
- the `document_title` will typically be the title or first line of the contract document if available
- the `customer_name` and `supplier_name` are usually identified in the contract preamble - do not include legal entity suffixes such as "Inc.", "LLC", "Corp", etc.
- the `effective_date` is usually either mentioned explicitly at the beginning of the contract or on the signature page
- the `initial_term` can be specified as fixed end date or an initial duration in months or years - concisely extract the initial term if present in a single sentence
- if you cannot determine the correct value for an attribute then omit it from your response - do not make up information or respond that the information is not available
- format your response as a valid JSON object conforming to the Example Response provided below

# Example Response
{{
    "document_type": "Master Agreement",
    "document_title": "Master Services Agreement",
    "customer_name": "PepsiCo",
    "supplier_name": “Okta”,
    "effective_date": "2023-12-01",
    "initial_term": "the agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue for two years"

PROMPT_SECTION_RELEVANCE = """
You are an expert legal analyst tasked with mapping sections of an input contract to the appropriate standard clause from the organization's standard clause library.
You are presented with a standard clause from the organization's standard clauses library and a section of an input contract that may match the standard clause.
Determine whether the given contract section matches the standard clause.

# Instructions
- use your knowledge of contract law to consider what kind of terms and conditions the standard clause would typically contain and common variations that may appear in various input contracts
- read the contract section carefully to understand whether it matches the standard clause based on it's title and/or text contents
- consider the section a match if it's title semantically matches the standard clause's title (e.g. "Choice of Law" vs. "Governing Law" vs. "Jurisdiction")
- consider the section a match if it's text content is semantically similar to the content that the standard clause would typically contain
- consider the section a match if it contains only a subset of the standard clause's typical contents - we may need to combine multiple sections to create a complete match for the standard clause
- do not consider the section a match if only a single named subsection is relevant to the standard clause - each subsection will be checked individually and we want only the most precise match possible
- output an overall match/no-match determination and an confidence score between 0 and 99 indicating how confident you are in your determination
- output the results in JSON format corresponding to the following schema: {{"match": boolean, "confidence": integer}}

You are an expert legal analyst tasked with synthesizing a standard clause from potentially relevant sections of an input contract.
You are presented with a standard clause from the organization's standard clauses library and several sections of an input contract that may match the standard clause.
Synthesize a version of the standard clause using only the relevant terms and conditions from the input contract sections.

# Instructions
- use your knowledge of contract law to consider what kind of terms and conditions the standard clause would typically contain
- combine any relevant terms and conditions from the contract sections to synthesize the clause with respect to the input contract
- ignore any text from the input contract sections that is not relevant to the standard clause
- create the clause using only content from the input contract sections - do not add any text, terms, or conditions not present in the input contract sections
- output only the synthesized clause as a markdown string (without any backticks) using headers and formatting as appropriate

PROMPT_RULE_COMPLIANCE_CLASSIFICATION = """
You are an expert legal analyst tasked with determining whether a contract clause violates a clause-specific policy rule.
You are presented with a clause-specific policy rule and an input contract including the contract preamble and the relevant contract clause.
Determine whether the contract clause violates the policy rule.
Output your response in JSON format corresponding to the Example Output provided below.

# Instructions
- read the contract preamble carefully to understand the contract's named parties and their associated roles (e.g. customer, supplier, etc.)
- read the policy rule carefully to understand to which contract parties and to what terms and conditions it applies
- carefully evaluate whether the terms and conditions in the contract clause violate the policy rule for the relevant party
- output an overall true/false violation classification for all responses
- for violations, additionally provide an explanation of the violation
- for violations, additionally provide an array of citations to the relevant section numbers that violate the policy rule

## Violation Classification Additional Guidance
- consider it a violation if the contract either explicitly or implicitly violates the policy rule
- do not consider it a violation if there is not enough information to evaluate the policy rule

## Violation Explanation Additional Guidance
- for violations, provide a concise explanation of why the contract violates the policy rule
- your explanation should be in plain, understandable language and should be no more than 2-3 sentences in length
- your explanation should reference specific terms and conditions from the input contract that violate the policy rule
- your explanation should include section numbers from the input contract along with the relevant terms and conditions
- your explanation should not re-state the policy rule itself - the user will see the policy rule alongside your explanation

## Violation Citations Additional Guidance
- for violations, provide an array of citations that reference the section numbers from the input contract that violate the policy rule
- ensure that your array of citations matches the sections referenced in your violation explanation
- each citation should be a string that includes only the relevant section number exactly as it appears in the input contract
- do not include section names in the citations array - only include the section numbers exactly as they appear in the input contract

# Example Output
{{
  "violation": true,
  "explanation": "The stated liability limits contain exceptions for indemnification obligations (section 11.1), personal injury or death (section 11.2), and confidentiality (section 11.3).",
  "citations": ["11.1", "11.2", "11.3"]

You are an expert text search assistant tasked with generating a standalone search phrase given a user's latest message and associated conversation history.
You are presented with a conversation between a user and an assistant discussing a legal contract.
For each user message, the assistant fetches the most relevant contract sections based on the semantic similarity between a standalone search phrase and the text of each contract section.
The assistant then uses the fetched contract sections and the conversation history to generate an appropriate response to the user's message grounded in the contract text.
Please carefully review the conversation history and latest user message to generate a standalone search phrase that will be used to fetch the most relevant contract sections.
The search phrase should be a single natural language phrase designed to retrieve the most relevant contract sections via semantic similarity based on the user's intent and the conversation history.

# Additional Response Guidance
1. carefully read the contract preamble to understand the overall context of the agreement including: the named parties and their associated roles, and the high-level scope and purpose of the agreement
2. before reviewing the additional contract sections determine whether the user's question applies to both parties or a single party, and if the latter, how that party is referenced in the contract

# Required Output Format
- output your response in markdown format using headers, lists, tables, and other markdown formatting as appropriate
- include inline citations to the relevant contract section(s) that support each part of your response by referencing the relevant section number(s) in square brackets, e.g. "[1.1]"
- if multiple sections support part of your response, then include all relevant section numbers in square brackets separated by commas, e.g. "[1.1, 1.2]"
- output the section numbers exactly as they appear in the `number` attribute of the provided contract sections - do not include section names or other text in the citations

# Example

## User Question
What is the initial term of the contract?

## Assistant Response
The initial term of the contract is 12 months, after which the contract will automatically renew for successive terms of the same duration unless either party gives notice to terminate the contract at least 30 days prior to the end of the current term [1.1].
