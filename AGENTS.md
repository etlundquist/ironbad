- do not edit whitespace of existing lines if there are no surrounding non-whitespace suggestions
- never make whitespace-only edit suggestions
- never make comment-only edit suggestions
- try to fit edits on a single line when doing so would make the code more clear and the line width would be at most 120 characters
